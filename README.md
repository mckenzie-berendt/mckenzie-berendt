### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a student at the University of Alberta studying Full Stack Web Development. I am most interested in learning more about JavaScript, React and C#. In my spare time, I am currently learning more about Next.js. I live in Canmore, Alberta & Bend, Oregon as a dual citizen. and I like rock climbing and dogs.
